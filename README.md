# IDO-Frontend
### Set up the backend server first!
#### Clone the repository
#### cd to IDO-Frontend directory
#### run the command `npm i` and wait for the installation
#### run the command `npm start` to run the application

### Notes about the application
- I used React.
- The Login functionality is implemented correctly, it's functional with database.
- Adding a new card will insert it at the bottom of the "Todo" list.
- You can search by all info in card.
- You can click on info to in card to show input and change data.
- The user logo is still a placeholder and not a dynamic one yet.
- The application uses simple sql server built in data, So you should make database first then connect with backend to run.
